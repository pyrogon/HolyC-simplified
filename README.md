# HolyC-simplified
HolyC, The absolute know nothing beginners guide.
---------------------------------------
This Guide is not intended to be used as reference for more advanced users of HolyC and TempleOS. This guide is designed to quickly explain basic functions of HolyC so that new users of HolyC may quickly begin writing their own projects. This guide only covers the absolute basics.

## Please note that I am not a software developer, nor am I an expert in C, HolyC, or any other programming language. This documention only exists as a means for me to share my understanding of TempleOS as I personally discover how it works. If possible, get better advice from others within the TempleOS community.
